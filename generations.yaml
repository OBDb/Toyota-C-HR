    description: "The first-generation Toyota C-HR (Compact High-Rider or Coupe High-Rider) represented Toyota's bold entry into the competitive subcompact crossover segment, featuring radical styling that departed significantly from the brand's typically conservative design language. With its dramatic coupe-like roofline, prominent character lines, bulging wheel arches, and concealed rear door handles, the C-HR prioritized distinctive style over traditional SUV practicality. Built on Toyota's TNGA-C platform shared with the Corolla and Prius, the C-HR offered car-like handling with a higher seating position and slightly increased ground clearance. Powertrain options varied by market but typically included a 1.2-liter turbocharged four-cylinder in Europe, a 1.8-liter hybrid system shared with the Prius in some regions, and a naturally aspirated 2.0-liter four-cylinder producing 144 horsepower in North America. Most markets received either a continuously variable transmission (CVT) or six-speed manual, with front-wheel drive standard and all-wheel drive available in select regions. The interior featured a driver-focused asymmetrical dashboard design with a soft-touch upper section and diamond pattern motifs echoing the exterior styling, though rear seat space and visibility were compromised by the dramatic roofline and small windows. Equipment levels were generally good with standard features including dual-zone climate control, touchscreen infotainment, and Toyota Safety Sense active safety systems. A facelift in 2020 brought subtle styling revisions, an improved infotainment system with smartphone integration, and in some markets, a more powerful 2.0-liter hybrid system. The first-generation C-HR successfully attracted younger buyers to the Toyota brand with its distinctive styling and driving dynamics that prioritized handling over off-road capability, though its form-over-function design polarized opinions and limited its appeal to more practically-minded consumers."

    description: "The second-generation Toyota C-HR continues the model's focus on distinctive styling while refining the formula with more sophisticated design, enhanced technology, and an increased emphasis on electrification. Though still featuring a coupe-like silhouette with a sloping roofline and angular character lines, the new C-HR adopts more mature, cohesive styling with flush door handles, seamless LED light bars front and rear, and a less busy overall appearance despite maintaining its bold character. Built on an updated version of the TNGA-C platform, the C-HR is available exclusively with hybrid powertrains in most markets, including a 1.8-liter hybrid system producing 140 horsepower and a more powerful 2.0-liter hybrid generating 196 horsepower, with a plug-in hybrid variant added in some regions offering approximately 60 kilometers of electric-only range. All powertrains utilize an electronically controlled continuously variable transmission (e-CVT) with front-wheel drive standard and all-wheel drive available on selected variants through the addition of a rear electric motor. The interior represents a significant advancement with higher quality materials, a streamlined design featuring ambient lighting, and Toyota's latest technology including dual 12.3-inch displays for instrumentation and infotainment, wireless smartphone integration, and cloud-based navigation. While rear seat space remains somewhat compromised by the sloping roofline, access has improved through larger door openings and slightly increased dimensions. Safety technology has expanded with the latest generation of Toyota Safety Sense, offering enhanced autonomous emergency braking, adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go functionality, lane tracing assist, and new features including safe exit assist and rear seat reminder. A key focus for this generation is sustainability, with extensive use of recycled and bio-based materials throughout the interior. The second-generation C-HR maintains the original's focus on distinctive styling and car-like dynamics while offering a more refined package with improved efficiency through its hybrid-only powertrain strategy, positioning it as a design-focused alternative in the increasingly crowded compact crossover segment."
